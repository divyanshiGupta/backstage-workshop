# Creating a Backend Plugin

### Create a Plugin ([Backstage's guide to create a backend Plugin](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/backend-plugin))

1. Execute the following command from the root of your Backstage repo to create a backend Plugin

   ```
   yarn new --select backend-plugin
   ```

2. The wizard will ask for a Plugin id. Enter Id `test` and proceed

3. Run the following commands to start the backend plugin in standalone mode

   ```
   cd plugins/test-backend
   yarn start
   ```

4. Run the following command in another terminal

   ```
   curl localhost:7007/test/health
   ```

   The above action should return `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Integrate the plugin in the Backstage backend

1. Run the following command from your Backstage root directory

   ```
   yarn add --cwd packages/backend @internal/plugin-carmen-backend@^0.1.0
   ```

2. Create a new file named `packages/backend/src/plugins/test.ts`, and add the following to it

   ```ts title=test.ts
   import { createRouter } from "@internal/plugin-test-backend";
   import { Router } from "express";
   import { PluginEnvironment } from "../types";

   export default async function createPlugin(
     env: PluginEnvironment
   ): Promise<Router> {
   // Here is where you will add all of the required initialization code that
   // your backend plugin needs to be able to start!
   
   // The env contains a lot of goodies, but our router currently only
   // needs a logger
     return await createRouter({
       logger: env.logger,
     });
   }
   ```

3. And finally, wire this into the overall backend router. Edit `packages/backend/src/index.ts`

   ```ts title=index.ts
   import test from './plugins/test';
   ...
   async function main() {
     ...
     const testEnv = useHotMemoize(module, () => createEnv('test'));
     apiRouter.use('/test', await test(testEnv));
   ```

4. Stress test your service. Run the following command from the root of the repository

   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

5. From another terminal execute the following `curl` command

   ```
   curl localhost:7007/api/test/health
   ```

   The above action should return the same response as above `{"status":"ok"}`

### Reading Backstage configuration using the Config API ([Backstage's guide to read configuration](https://backstage.io/docs/conf/reading))

1. Add the following in the `test.ts` file

   ```
   ...
   config: env.config,
   ```

2. Copy the contents of the `router.ts` file in this folder and paste it in the `plugins/test-backend/src/service/router.ts` file of your backend plugin

3. In the `app-config.yaml` add the following configuration

   ```
   test-plugin:
     configA: "This is configA"
     configB: "This is configB"

   ```

4. From another terminal execute the following `curl` command

   ```
   curl localhost:7007/api/test/config/configA
   ```

   The above action should return the same response as above `{"status":"ok","value":"This is configA"}`

### Discover other plugins using the Discover API

1. Add the following in the `test.ts` file

   ```
   ...
   discovery: env.discovery,
   ```

2. From another terminal execute the following `curl` command

   ```
   curl localhost:7007/api/test/user
   ```

   The above action should return the same response as above `{"status":"ok","value":"Divyanshi Gupta"}`

### Use the newly created service in your frontend Plugin

1. Copy the contents of the `ExampleComponent.tsx` file in this folder and paste it in the `ExampleComponent.tsx` file in your frontend plugin path
